FAVICON SETUP NOTE
==================

A favicon.svg file has been created and is working for modern browsers.

For better compatibility with older browsers, you can generate a proper favicon.ico file:

1. Visit https://favicon.io or https://realfavicongenerator.net
2. Upload the favicon.svg or create a new design (recommended: 512x512px)
3. Download the generated favicon.ico file
4. Place it in this directory (frontend/public/favicon.ico)

The current SVG favicon will work for most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
